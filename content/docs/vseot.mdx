## Ingredients

- 50g cherry tomatoes, halved
- 30ml milk (optional, for creaminess)

3.  While the vegetables cook, toast the wholemeal bread.
4.  In a small bowl, whisk the eggs with milk (if using), salt, and pepper.

  <Tab value="Tips">
    - For the creamiest eggs, cook them "low and slow". Remove them from the heat just before they look done, as they will continue to cook.
    - Don't salt the eggs until the end of cooking to ensure they stay tender and soft.
    - Lightly season the vegetables as they cook in the pan to build more flavour.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Variations">
    - Add other vegetables like chopped mushrooms, onions, or bell peppers. Sauté them before adding the spinach.
    - Sprinkle feta, goat cheese, or grated cheddar into the eggs during the last 30 seconds of cooking.
    - Top with sliced avocado for healthy fats or a dash of hot sauce for a spicy kick.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Meal Prep">
    - This dish is best made fresh for the best texture.
    - To save time in the morning, you can pre-chop all your vegetables and store them in an airtight container in the fridge.
    - This allows you to simply toss them in the pan for a super quick assembly.
