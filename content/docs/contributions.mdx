  Following these steps ensures that any new recipes added are consistent with the current structure and can be merged smoothly.

### Create Your MDX File

First, create a new file inside the `content/docs` directory. The easiest way to start is to copy and paste an existing recipe file (like `proat.mdx`) and use it as a template.

<Files>
  <Folder name="content" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="docs" defaultOpen>
        <File name="gypb.mdx" />
        <File name="proat.mdx" />
        <File name="your-new-recipe.mdx" />
      </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="src" />
  <File name="package.json" />
  <File name="README.md" />
</Files>

### File Naming

Name your new file using the first letter of each word in the recipe's title. The format should be all lowercase.

<Callout title="File Naming Convention" type="info">
  **Example:** A recipe titled `Veggie Scrambled Eggs on Toast` would be named `vseot.mdx`. If the name is shorter like `Protein Oatmeal`, something like `proat.mdx` would be fine.
</Callout>

### Update `content/docs/meta.json`

You must register your new page. Open the `meta.json` file add your new file's name (without the `.mdx` extension) to the `"pages"` array. This makes it appear in the sidebar navigation.

```json title="/content/docs/meta.json"
{
  "pages": [
    "---Recipes---"
    "gypb",
    "proat",
    "vseot",
    "your-new-filename-here"
  ]
}
```

### Update `.github/CODEOWNERS`
To keep a record of who is responsible for the content, add your GitHub username to the `CODEOWNERS` file.

```plaintext title="/.github/CODEOWNERS"
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
/content/docs/proat.mdx @github-username
```

### Open a Pull Request

Once you have completed all the steps, commit your changes and open a Pull Request on GitHub.

Your submission will be reviewed, and once approved, your recipe will be live!
