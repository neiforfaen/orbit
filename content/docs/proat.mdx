  <Tab value="Tips">
    - Always stir protein powder in *after* cooking the oats. Adding it before microwaving can make it clumpy and rubbery.
    - Use a larger bowl than you think you need to prevent the oats from boiling over.
    - If the oatmeal is too thick after adding protein, stir in an extra splash of milk to reach your desired consistency.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Variations">
    - Stir in a tablespoon of peanut or almond butter for extra flavour and healthy fats.
    - Swap the banana for a handful of fresh berries, chopped apple, or a spoonful of pumpkin purée.
    - Use different flavoured protein powders like salted caramel or strawberry for variety.
    - Add 1 tbsp of cocoa powder with chocolate protein for a rich, chocolatey bowl.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Meal Prep">
    - Create "dry packs": Portion oats, protein powder, chia seeds, and cinnamon into small bags or containers. In the morning, just add liquid and microwave.
    - For a no-cook option, make it as overnight oats. Combine all ingredients in a jar, stir well, and refrigerate overnight. Enjoy it cold in the morning.
