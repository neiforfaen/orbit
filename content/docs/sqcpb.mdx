## Ingredients

- 120g boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 tsp olive oil
- Seasoning for chicken: pinch of salt, black pepper, dried oregano, and garlic powder
- 1/2 cup (90g) dry quinoa, rinsed
- 1 cup (240ml) water or low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 cup chopped spinach or mixed greens
- 1/4 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/4 cup cucumber, diced
- 1/4 medium avocado, sliced
- **For the dressing:**
- 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- A pinch of salt and pepper

## Instructions

1.  **Cook the Quinoa:** Place rinsed quinoa and water/broth in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork.
2.  **Cook the Chicken:** While the quinoa simmers, heat 1 tsp of olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and season with salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic powder. Cook for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through.
3.  **Prep the Veggies & Dressing:** While the chicken and quinoa are cooking, chop your tomatoes and cucumber. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper for the dressing.
4.  **Assemble the Bowl:** Place the spinach/mixed greens in the bottom of a bowl. Top with the cooked quinoa, the lemon-herb chicken, cherry tomatoes, and cucumber.
5.  **Finish and Serve:** Add the sliced avocado and drizzle the lemon dressing over everything. Enjoy immediately.

<Tabs items={['Tips', 'Variations', 'Meal Prep']} className="mb-10 mt-12">
  <Tab value="Tips">
    - To save time, use a 90-second microwaveable quinoa pouch.
    - Rinsing quinoa before cooking removes its natural saponin coating, which can give it a bitter taste.
    - Don't overcrowd the pan when cooking chicken to ensure it gets a nice golden-brown sear.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Variations">
    - Swap chicken for grilled salmon, shrimp, or a can of chickpeas for a vegetarian option.
    - Use brown rice or farro instead of quinoa.
    - Add other veggies like bell peppers, red onion, or crumbled feta cheese.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Meal Prep">
    - Cook a double batch of the chicken and quinoa at the start of the week.
    - Store the chicken, quinoa, and chopped veggies in separate airtight containers in the fridge.
    - Keep the dressing in a small jar and the avocado whole until you're ready to assemble and serve. This takes less than 5 minutes!
