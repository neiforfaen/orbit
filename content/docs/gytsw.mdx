## Ingredients

- 1 can (150g) of tuna in water, drained well
- 1/3 cup (85g) plain Greek yogurt
- 1 celery stalk, finely diced
- 1 tbsp red onion, finely diced
- 1 tbsp fresh dill or parsley, chopped
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- A squeeze of fresh lemon juice
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 4-5 large, crisp lettuce leaves (Romaine or Iceberg work well)

## Instructions

1.  **Drain the Tuna:** Open the can of tuna and press the lid firmly against it to drain out all the water. This is key to avoiding a watery salad.
2.  **Flake the Tuna:** Flake the drained tuna into a medium bowl with a fork.
3.  **Mix the Ingredients:** Add the Greek yogurt, diced celery, red onion, fresh herbs, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice to the bowl with the tuna.
4.  **Combine and Season:** Mix everything together until well combined. Add salt and pepper and taste, adjusting seasoning if needed.
5.  **Assemble the Wraps:** Carefully wash and dry the lettuce leaves. Spoon the tuna salad mixture evenly into the lettuce cups and serve immediately.

  <Tab value="Tips">
    - Draining the tuna properly is the most important step for a creamy, not watery, texture.
    - Use the sturdiest outer leaves of the lettuce for the best "cups" that won't tear.
    - For extra creaminess, use 2% or full-fat Greek yogurt.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Variations">
    - Add a tablespoon of capers or some chopped pickles for a briny kick.
    - Swap tuna for canned salmon or shredded cooked chicken.
    - If you aren't avoiding carbs, this salad is also excellent in a whole-wheat pita or wrap with some added spinach.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Meal Prep">
    - The tuna salad mixture can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
    - To prevent sogginess, store the lettuce leaves separately and assemble the wraps just before eating.
