# ü™ê Orbit

A personal constellation of curated recipes. Orbit is a clean, fast, and modern home for my favourite meals, built with Waku and Fumadocs.

## About

This project was born from a desire to have a single, beautifully organized place to store recipes I find and love. Instead of cluttered bookmarks or lost notes, Orbit serves as a central hub ‚Äî a personal cookbook that I can access anywhere and update easily.

It uses a documentation-first framework to keep the focus on the content, ensuring that recipes are easy to read, follow, and find.

## Key Features

-   **Clean & Minimalist UI**: A beautiful, distraction-free interface powered by Fumadocs.
-   **Blazingly Fast**: Built on Waku for optimal performance and a great user experience.
-   **Macro Focused**: Each recipe includes a quick overview of calories, protein, and other key macros.
-   **Easy to Contribute**: Adding new recipes is as simple as creating a new Markdown (MDX) file.
-   **Built-in Search**: Instantly find any recipe, ingredient, or instruction.
